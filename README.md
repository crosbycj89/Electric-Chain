# Electric-Chain
The Electric Chain is an open science project dedicated to the intersection of solar energy, IoT and blockchain technology. One of the Electric Chain’s goals is to connect the world’s 7 million solar facilities, watching the skies 24/7 and posting live data to one blockchain for scientists, researchers and human progress. Initial focus is on verifying and publishing solar power generation data publicly in near real time. The Electric Chain project supports the development of open standards and tools to publish and read solar electricity generation data using the Solar Chain blockchain and/or other blockchain technologies.
